## Components of a heuristic
#### Example of a problem to be solved using a heuristic:
which chick does the bird parent feed first when it comes back from scavenging
multiple chicks
multiple dimension along which we can rate each chick (weight, hunger, volume, size, etc.)

Bird parent's question: Which one to feed first? (strategy presumably encoded evolutionarily)
Psychologists question: How to determine the strategy to decide which to feed (i.e. find a way to decide how you're going to decide decide :D = search for a heuristic)

#### Classes of heuristics:
1. Ignorance-based decision making
2. One-reason decision making
3. Elimination for multiple choice
4. Satisficing


## Heuristic building blocks:
#### Stopping rule
(a rule when the person stops a search)
e.g.:
- satisficing (Herbert Simon)  - first one that meets a set standard, if not met, lower standard and re-search

#### Search order of cue dimensions
(each decision has multiple criteria to be judged on, this is the strategy determining which one to start with)
- **minimalist** (random order of options to cycle through)
- **take the best** (the one that has the highest validity - determined by counting accuracy of each heuristic for each of the decisions in the past)
- **take the last** (decision dimensions searched in order of reverse chronology)

#### Nesting: subsetting heuristics to heuristics
